2. Add the item(s) you want with the plus button or remove them with the minus button.

There is a number of extra features to help you decide where to eat, such as:
- Colour-coded rating from 1 to 5 stars.
- 1-3 â‚¬ symbols that determine how expensive the restaurant is based on the average price of their items.
- Distance to the restaurant, which is found in the map view.
<br><br>

The app also has some additional features like:
- A map view that shows you a route from your current location to the restaurant you selected. This is found within the resturants menu fragment when you click the map icon.
- You can also favourite resturants by tapping the heart button, which will turn red when pressed. These favourites are then found in the favourites page which can be accessed via the heart icon at the top right of the restaurants page.

### Businesses

Businesses can log into their account and receive your order, which shows them:
- Your order ID.
- The items you ordered.
- Total price of your order.
- Time of order.

Once you arrive and pick up your food, they mark it as complete with the "Mark as Done" button. The business can also see how many orders have been placed and the revenue they have made through the app.
